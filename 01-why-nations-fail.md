# Preface
The roots of discontent in countries such as Egypt, lie in their poverty. The protestors in Tahrir Square spoke with one voice about the corruption of the government, its inability to deliver public services, and lack of equality of opportunity in their country. Egyptians and Tunisians both saw their economic problems as being fundamentally caused by their lack of political rights.  

They recognize that the roots of these problems are political. All the economic impediments they face, stem from the way political power in Egypt is exercised, and monopolized by a narrow elite. 

Egypt is poor, precisely because it has been ruled by a narrow elite that have organized society for their benefit, at the expense of the vast mass of people. Political power has been narrowly concentrated, and has been used to create great wealth for those who possesses it. 

Poor countries are poor for the same reason that Egypt is poor. Countries such as Great Britain and the United States became rich, because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power, and created a society where political rights were much more broadly distributed, where the government was accountable and responsive to citizens, and where the great mass of people could take advantage of economic opportunities. 

The reason that Britain is richer than Egypt, is because in 1688, Britain had a revolution that transformed the politics, and thus the economics of the nation. 

Though in 1952, the Egyptians overthrew their monarchy (Ottoman and British empires), rather than fundamentally transforming their politics, they brought power to another elite, as disinterested in achieving prosperity for ordinary Egyptians as the Ottoman had been. Thus Egypt stayed poor. 

Egypt has had revolutions in the past, that did not change things, because those who mounted the revolutions simply took over the reins from whose they had deposed, and re-created a similar system. 

It is indeed difficult for ordinary citizens to acquire real political power, and change the way their society works. But it is possible. 

Fundamentally, it is a political transformation of this sort that is required for a poor society to become rich. 

# 1. So close and yet so different
## The economies of the Rio Grande
The residents fo Nogales, Arizona, US, take it for granted that, with all its inefficiency and occasional corruption, the government is their agent. They can vote to replace their mayor, congressmen, and senators; they vote in the presidential elections, that wil determine who will lead their country. Democracy is their 2nd nature. 

Life south of the border, for the residents of Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, is very different. Crime is high, and opening a business is a risky activity. Not only do you risk robbery, but getting all the permissions, and greasing all the palms just to open, is no easy endeavor. Residents live with politician's corruption and ineptitude every day. 

Nogales, Arizona, is in the US, which enable residents to choose their occupations freely, acquire schooling and skills, and encourage their employers to invest in the best technology, which leads to higher wages for them. They also have access to political institutions that allow them to take part in the democratic process, to elect their representatives, and replace them if they misbehave. In consequence, politicians provide the basic services that the citizens demand. 

Societies were formed differently during the early colonial period, leading to different institutions to present day. 

## The founding of Buenos Aires
In the 1500s, English colonists reached South America, they were not interested in tilling the soil themselves - they wanted others to do it for them, and they wanted riches, gold and silver, to plunder. 

## From Cajamarca
The Spanish found that the best way for them to subdue opposition, was to capture the indigenous leader. In Calca and Acomayo, people grow the same crops, but in Calca, they sell them on the market for money. In Acamayo they grow food for their own subsistence. The major differences between the two places, is that Acomayo was in the catchment area of the Potosi mita (brutal forced labor system). 

Throughout the Spanish colonial world in the Americas, similar institutions and social structure emerged. Besides looting, the Spanish created a web of institutions designed to exploit the indigenous peoples. The system was designed to force indigenous people's living standards down to a subsistence level, and thus extract all income in excess of this for Spanish elites. This was achieved by:
- expropriating their land
- forcing them to work
- offering low wages for labor services
- imposing high taxes
- charging high prices for goods that wer not even voluntarily bought. 

Though these institutions generated a lot of wealth for the Spanish Crown, and made the conquistadors and their descendants very rich, they also turned Latin America into the most unequal continent in the world, and sapped much ouf its economic potential. 

## To Jamestown
In the 1600s, English colonists arrived at Jamestown, VA, US. Due to population density, and impossible to coerce neither locals or settlers, they adopted a new strategy: give the settlers incentives. In 1618, the Virginia Company begant he "headright system", which gave each male settler 50 acres of land, and 50 more acres for each member of his family and their servants. Settlers were given houses, and in 1619 a General Assembly was introduced, that effectively gave all men a say in the laws and institutions governing the colony. It was the start of democracy in the United States. 

The rest of the 1600s saw a long series of struggles over the 2nd lesson: that the only option for an economically viable colony, was to create institutions that gave colonists incentives to invest, and to work hard. 

As North America developed, English elites tried time and time again to setup institutions that would heavily restrict the economic and political rights for all, but a privileged few, just as the Spanish did. Yet in each case this model broke down, as it had in Virginia. It was impossible to force settlers into a rigid hierarchical society, because there were simply to many options open to them in the New World. Instead, they had to be provided with incentives for them to want to work. And soon, they were demanding more economic freedom, and further political rights. 

By the 1720s, all the 13 colonies of what was to become the United States had similar structures of government. They were not democracies; women, slaves, and propertyless could not vote. But political rights were very broad, compared with contemporary societies elsewhere. 

It was these assemblies and their leaders that coalesced to form the First Continental Congress in 1774, the prelude to the independence of the United States. The assemblies believed they had the right to determine both their own membership, and the right to taxation. 

## A tale of two constitutions
The document that the delegates sat down to write in Philadelphia in 1787-05 was a long process initiated by the formation of the General Assembly in Jamestown in 1619. 

The Constitution of the US did not create a democracy by modern standards. Who could vote in elections was left up to the individual states to determine. 

The most sordid negotiation concerned the division of the seats in the House of Representatives among the states. These were to be allocated on the basis of a state's population, but the congressional representatives of southern states then demanded that the slaves be counted. Northerners objected. The compromise was that in apportioning seats to the House of Representatives, a slave would count as 3/5 of a free person. 

These fudges kept the political institutions of the US working peacefully, until the Civil War finally resolved the conflicts in favor of the North. 

If the US experienced 5 years of political instability between 1860 and 1865, Mexico experienced almost nonstop instability for the first 50 years of independence. 

The motivation behind the Mexican declaration of independence, was to protect the set of economic institutions developed during the colonial period, which had made Mexico "the country of inequality". These institutions, by basing the society on the exploitation of indigenous people, and the creation of monopolies, blocked the economic incentives and initiatives of the great mass of the population. 

## Having an idea, starting a firm, and getting a loan
The engine of technological breakthroughs throughout the economy was innovation, spearheaded by new entrepreneurs and businessman eager to apply their new ideas. 

The striking thing about the evidence on patenting in the US, is that people who were granted patents came from all sorts of backgrounds and all walks of life, not just the rich and the elite. 

Just as the US in the 1800s was more democratic politically than almost any other nation in the world at the time, it was also more democratic than others when it came to innovation. This was critical to its path to becoming the most economically innovative nation in the world. 

During the 1800s, there was a rapid expansion of financial intermediation and banking, that was a crucial facilitator of the rapid growth and industrialization that the economy experienced. Potential investors in teh US had ready access to capital to start their businesses. Moreover, the intense competition among banks and financial institutions in the US meant that the capital was available at fairly low interest rates. 

Unlike in the US, where competition was fierce, there was practically no competition among Mexican banks. It meant that the banks were able to charge their consumers very high interest rates, and typically confined lending to the privileged and the already wealthy, who would then use their access to credit to increase their grip over the various sectors of the economy. 

Similar to Mexico, military men sometimes enter politics. However, non of the US military men used force to get into power, nor did they use force to avoid having to relinquish power - they abided by the Constitution. However, Mexican presidents could only be removed from power the same way they had attained it: by the use of force. 

Mexican presidents violated people's property rights, facilitating the expropriation of land, and granted monopolies/favors to his supporters in all lines of business. 

The profit motive. Same in the US, politicians tried to set up state banking monopolies, which they could give to their allies in exchange for part of the monopoly profits. However, they are subject to election and reelection, so the situation was not sustainable. 

Unlike Mexico, in the US, the citizens could keep politicians in check, and get rid of the ones who would use their offices to enrich themselves, or create monopolies for their cronies. 

The broad distribution of political rights in the US guaranteed equal access to finance and loans. This in turn ensured that those with ideas and inventions could benefit from them. 

## Path-dependent change
The world economy boomed in the 1850s, and innovations in transportation, such as the steamship and the railway, led to a huge expansion of international trade. This meant that the elites in the resource rich Mexico could enrich themselves by exporting raw materials to industrializing North America or Western Europe.  They made a "path-dependent" change, leading only to the next stage of the institutions that had already made much of Latin America poor and unequal. 

Globalization made the large open spaces of the Americas (the open frontiers) valuable. 
- In the US, a long series of legislative acts, ranging form the Land Ordinance of 1785, to the Homestead Act of 1862, gae broad access to frontier lands. This created an egalitarian (equal) and economically dynamic frontier. 
- In most Latin America countries, Frontier lands were allocated to elites, making such people even more powerful. 

Though there was a gradual drift toward greater political rights, it was only in the 1990s that most Latin American countries became democracies, and even then, they remain mired in instability, accompanied by mass repression and murder. 

## Making a billion or two
US: Bill Gates, as the world's richest person, and the founder of one of the most technologically innovative companies. Microsoft abused monopoly power by tieing its Web browser to its Windows OS, got its wings clipped by the Federal Trader Commission. 

Mexico: Carlos Slim, the other richest men, did not make his money by innovation. Hi acquired Telmex, making a hugely profitable public telecommunications monopoly his own monopoly. He made his money in the Mexican economy thanks to his political connections. 

If you are a Mexican entrepreneur, entry barriers will stand in your way: expensive licenses, red tapes, politicians and incumbents stopping you, difficulty of getting funding, etc. These barriers, depending on who you know and who you can bribe, can be either:
1. your enemy and keep you out of lucrative areas,
2. your greatest friend, keeping your competitors at bay. 

There have been challenges to Slim's Telmex monopoly, but they have not been successful. They can use "appeal for protection" to argue that a particular low doesn't apply to them. Rather than protecting people's rights, it provides a loophole in equality before the law. 

## Toward a theory of world inequality
Rich countries typically have governments that do not arbitrarily arrest or harass residents. On the contrary, the governments provide services (education, healthcare, roads, law, order, etc). The citizens vote in elections, and have some voice in the political direction their countries take. 

The great differences in world inequality are evident to everyone, which drive people to cross the Rio Grande or the Mediterranean sea illegally, to have the chance to experience rich-country living standards and opportunities. 


Nogales, as  in the rest of northern Mexico, benefits from trade with the US. Its relative prosperity came from US-based manufacturing plants (comes from outside of Mexico). 

The average citizen in the US is 7 times prosperous as that in Mexico, 10 times as Peru, 20 times as that of subSaran Africa, and 40 times of those living in the poorest African countries. And it is not just the US. There is a small and growing list of rich countries - mostly in Europe and North America, joined by Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. 

Political institutions determines how political process works, political process determines what economic institutions people live under, Economic institutions shape economic incentives (become educated, save and invest, innovate, adopt new tech, etc). 

For example, political institutions -> determines citizens' ability to control/influence politicians -> determines whether politicians are citizens' agents, or abuse the power, or amass their own fortunes and be detrimental to citizens' fortunes. 

Political institutions include, but are not limited to: written constitutions, and whether the society is a democracy. 

Individual talent matters everywhere, but even that needs an institutional framework, to transform it into a positive force. The talents in the US are sure that there is no risk of a dictator taking power, and changing the rules of the game, expropriating their wealth, imprisoning them, or threatening their lives and livelihoods. They also made sure that nothing could warp the government in an economically disastrous direction, because political power was limited and distributed broadly. 

Different patterns of institutions today are deeply rooted in the past, because once society gets organized in a particular way, this tends to persist. This persistence, and the forces that create it, also explains why it is so difficult to remove world inequality, and to make poor countries prosperous. 

There is no necessity for a society to develop/adapt the institutions that are best for economic growth, or the welfare of its citizens, because other institutions may be even better for those who control politics and political institutions.
