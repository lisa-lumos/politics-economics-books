# Preface
The roots of discontent in countries such as Egypt, lie in their poverty. The protestors in Tahrir Square spoke with one voice about the corruption of the government, its inability to deliver public services, and lack of equality of opportunity in their country. Egyptians and Tunisians both saw their economic problems as being fundamentally caused by their lack of political rights.  

They recognize that the roots of these problems are political. All the economic impediments they face, stem from the way political power in Egypt is exercised, and monopolized by a narrow elite. 

Egypt is poor, precisely because it has been ruled by a narrow elite that have organized society for their benefit, at the expense of the vast mass of people. Political power has been narrowly concentrated, and has been used to create great wealth for those who possesses it. 

Poor countries are poor for the same reason that Egypt is poor. Countries such as Great Britain and the United States became rich, because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power, and created a society where political rights were much more broadly distributed, where the government was accountable and responsive to citizens, and where the great mass of people could take advantage of economic opportunities. 

The reason that Britain is richer than Egypt, is because in 1688, Britain had a revolution that transformed the politics, and thus the economics of the nation. 

Though in 1952, the Egyptians overthrew their monarchy (Ottoman and British empires), rather than fundamentally transforming their politics, they brought power to another elite, as disinterested in achieving prosperity for ordinary Egyptians as the Ottoman had been. Thus Egypt stayed poor. 

Egypt has had revolutions in the past, that did not change things, because those who mounted the revolutions simply took over the reins from whose they had deposed, and re-created a similar system. 

It is indeed difficult for ordinary citizens to acquire real political power, and change the way their society works. But it is possible. 

Fundamentally, it is a political transformation of this sort that is required for a poor society to become rich. 

# 1. So close and yet so different
## The economies of the Rio Grande
The residents fo Nogales, Arizona, US, take it for granted that, with all its inefficiency and occasional corruption, the government is their agent. They can vote to replace their mayor, congressmen, and senators; they vote in the presidential elections, that wil determine who will lead their country. Democracy is their 2nd nature. 

Life south of the border, for the residents of Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, is very different. Crime is high, and opening a business is a risky activity. Not only do you risk robbery, but getting all the permissions, and greasing all the palms just to open, is no easy endeavor. Residents live with politician's corruption and ineptitude every day. 

Nogales, Arizona, is in the US, which enable residents to choose their occupations freely, acquire schooling and skills, and encourage their employers to invest in the best technology, which leads to higher wages for them. They also have access to political institutions that allow them to take part in the democratic process, to elect their representatives, and replace them if they misbehave. In consequence, politicians provide the basic services that the citizens demand. 

Societies were formed differently during the early colonial period, leading to different institutions to present day. 

## The founding of Buenos Aires
In the 1500s, English colonists reached South America, they were not interested in tilling the soil themselves - they wanted others to do it for them, and they wanted riches, gold and silver, to plunder. 

## From Cajamarca
The Spanish found that the best way for them to subdue opposition, was to capture the indigenous leader. In Calca and Acomayo, people grow the same crops, but in Calca, they sell them on the market for money. In Acamayo they grow food for their own subsistence. The major differences between the two places, is that Acomayo was in the catchment area of the Potosi mita (brutal forced labor system). 

Throughout the Spanish colonial world in the Americas, similar institutions and social structure emerged. Besides looting, the Spanish created a web of institutions designed to exploit the indigenous peoples. The system was designed to force indigenous people's living standards down to a subsistence level, and thus extract all income in excess of this for Spanish elites. This was achieved by:
- expropriating their land
- forcing them to work
- offering low wages for labor services
- imposing high taxes
- charging high prices for goods that wer not even voluntarily bought. 

Though these institutions generated a lot of wealth for the Spanish Crown, and made the conquistadors and their descendants very rich, they also turned Latin America into the most unequal continent in the world, and sapped much ouf its economic potential. 

## To Jamestown
In the 1600s, English colonists arrived at Jamestown, VA, US. Due to population density, and impossible to coerce neither locals or settlers, they adopted a new strategy: give the settlers incentives. In 1618, the Virginia Company begant he "headright system", which gave each male settler 50 acres of land, and 50 more acres for each member of his family and their servants. Settlers were given houses, and in 1619 a General Assembly was introduced, that effectively gave all men a say in the laws and institutions governing the colony. It was the start of democracy in the United States. 

The rest of the 1600s saw a long series of struggles over the 2nd lesson: that the only option for an economically viable colony, was to create institutions that gave colonists incentives to invest, and to work hard. 

As North America developed, English elites tried time and time again to setup institutions that would heavily restrict the economic and political rights for all, but a privileged few, just as the Spanish did. Yet in each case this model broke down, as it had in Virginia. It was impossible to force settlers into a rigid hierarchical society, because there were simply to many options open to them in the New World. Instead, they had to be provided with incentives for them to want to work. And soon, they were demanding more economic freedom, and further political rights. 

By the 1720s, all the 13 colonies of what was to become the United States had similar structures of government. They were not democracies; women, slaves, and propertyless could not vote. But political rights were very broad, compared with contemporary societies elsewhere. 

It was these assemblies and their leaders that coalesced to form the First Continental Congress in 1774, the prelude to the independence of the United States. The assemblies believed they had the right to determine both their own membership, and the right to taxation. 

## A tale of two constitutions
The document that the delegates sat down to write in Philadelphia in 1787-05 was a long process initiated by the formation of the General Assembly in Jamestown in 1619. 

The Constitution of the US did not create a democracy by modern standards. Who could vote in elections was left up to the individual states to determine. 

The most sordid negotiation concerned the division of the seats in the House of Representatives among the states. These were to be allocated on the basis of a state's population, but the congressional representatives of southern states then demanded that the slaves be counted. Northerners objected. The compromise was that in apportioning seats to the House of Representatives, a slave would count as 3/5 of a free person. 

These fudges kept the political institutions of the US working peacefully, until the Civil War finally resolved the conflicts in favor of the North. 

If the US experienced 5 years of political instability between 1860 and 1865, Mexico experienced almost nonstop instability for the first 50 years of independence. 

The motivation behind the Mexican declaration of independence, was to protect the set of economic institutions developed during the colonial period, which had made Mexico "the country of inequality". These institutions, by basing the society on the exploitation of indigenous people, and the creation of monopolies, blocked the economic incentives and initiatives of the great mass of the population. 

## Having an idea, starting a firm, and getting a loan
The engine of technological breakthroughs throughout the economy was innovation, spearheaded by new entrepreneurs and businessman eager to apply their new ideas. 

The striking thing about the evidence on patenting in the US, is that people who were granted patents came from all sorts of backgrounds and all walks of life, not just the rich and the elite. 

Just as the US in the 1800s was more democratic politically than almost any other nation in the world at the time, it was also more democratic than others when it came to innovation. This was critical to its path to becoming the most economically innovative nation in the world. 

During the 1800s, there was a rapid expansion of financial intermediation and banking, that was a crucial facilitator of the rapid growth and industrialization that the economy experienced. Moreover, the intense competition among banks and financial institutions in the US meant that the capital was available at fairly low interest rates.
