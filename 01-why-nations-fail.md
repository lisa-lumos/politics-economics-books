# Preface
The roots of discontent in countries such as Egypt, lie in their poverty. The protestors in Tahrir Square spoke with one voice about the corruption of the government, its inability to deliver public services, and lack of equality of opportunity in their country. Egyptians and Tunisians both saw their economic problems as being fundamentally caused by their lack of political rights.  

They recognize that the roots of these problems are political. All the economic impediments they face, stem from the way political power in Egypt is exercised, and monopolized by a narrow elite. 

Egypt is poor, precisely because it has been ruled by a narrow elite that have organized society for their benefit, at the expense of the vast mass of people. Political power has been narrowly concentrated, and has been used to create great wealth for those who possesses it. 

Poor countries are poor for the same reason that Egypt is poor. Countries such as Great Britain and the United States became rich, because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power, and created a society where political rights were much more broadly distributed, where the government was accountable and responsive to citizens, and where the great mass of people could take advantage of economic opportunities. 

The reason that Britain is richer than Egypt, is because in 1688, Britain had a revolution that transformed the politics, and thus the economics of the nation. 

Though in 1952, the Egyptians overthrew their monarchy (Ottoman and British empires), rather than fundamentally transforming their politics, they brought power to another elite, as disinterested in achieving prosperity for ordinary Egyptians as the Ottoman had been. Thus Egypt stayed poor. 

Egypt has had revolutions in the past, that did not change things, because those who mounted the revolutions simply took over the reins from whose they had deposed, and re-created a similar system. 

It is indeed difficult for ordinary citizens to acquire real political power, and change the way their society works. But it is possible. 

Fundamentally, it is a political transformation of this sort that is required for a poor society to become rich. 

# 1. So close and yet so different
The residents fo Nogales, Arizona, US, take it for granted that, with all its inefficiency and occasional corruption, the government is their agent. They can vote to replace their mayor, congressmen, and senators; they vote in the presidential elections, that wil determine who will lead their country. Democracy is their 2nd nature. 

Life south of the border, for the residents of Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, is very different. Crime is high, and opening a business is a risky activity. Not only do you risk robbery, but getting all the permissions, and greasing all the palms just to open, is no easy endeavor. Residents live with politician's corruption and ineptitude every day. 

Nogales, Arizona, is in the US, which enable residents to choose their occupations freely, acquire schooling and skills, and encourage their employers to invest in the best technology, which leads to higher wages for them. They also have access to political institutions that allow them to take part in the democratic process, to elect their representatives, and replace them if they misbehave. In consequence, politicians provide the basic services that the citizens demand.
